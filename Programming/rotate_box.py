### Information ###
# Box contains food packages.
# Size of the box is length (l) * 2 * height (h)
# Size of the food package is 2*2*2 (size of each box)
# Box is represented as array A
# During delivery box is rotated "k" times 90 degrees clockwise rotation
# K is inputted

# Code Input - Must separate each string, append to list

# Input
# 6 -> length
# 2 2 1 3 1 1 0-> elements of array
# 1 -> number f rotation

# Output
# 6 3 1

# Code constraints

# Dummy Input Temporary
length_n = 6
elements_a = [2,2,1,3,1,1]
rotate_k = 1

# print(type(length_n))
# print(type(elements_a))
# print(type(rotate_k))

# list_1 = [1, [2,3], 5, [7,8,9], 10]

# print(list_1[1][0])
# print(list_1[3][1:])
